This repository provides **3D-printable EEG electrodes** designed for **dry-contact** applications. The models were created in **Plasticity 3D** based on **scientific research** to enhance **wearing comfort and signal quality**. These electrodes can be integrated into **EEG caps** for **brain monitoring, neurofeedback, BCI applications, and long-term EEG recordings**.

## 📌 Electrode Designs  

The electrodes were **modeled in Plasticity 3D** based on blueprints derived from **scientific EEG research**.

### 1️⃣ Multipin Electrode  
A **pin-based dry EEG electrode** designed to ensure multiple contact points, improving signal acquisition for **hair-covered scalp areas**.  

📐 **Blueprint**  
![Multipin Blueprint](https://github.com/zavesone/EEG_electrodes/blob/main/multipin.jpg)  

- ✅ **High-density pin arrangement**
- ✅ **Optimized for dry-contact EEG**
- ✅ **Better stability and reduced movement artifacts**

---

### 2️⃣ Arch Electrode  
A novel **arch-shaped electrode** offering **greater comfort and adaptability**, ideal for **long-term EEG monitoring**.  

📐 **Blueprint**

## 🛠️ How to Use  

1. **Download the `.obj` file** for the electrode you want to print.  
2. **Use a 3D printer** (recommended: **TPU filament**) to fabricate the electrode.  
3. **Apply Ag/AgCl coating** (if needed) to improve conductivity.  
4. **Attach to an EEG cap** and connect to your EEG system.  
5. **Start recording high-quality brain signals**!
