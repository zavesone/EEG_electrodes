## 🧠 EEG Electrodes – 3D-Printed Dry Electrodes for EEG Applications

![Multipin Electrode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EEG_electrodes/main/multipin_render.png)

### Overview  
This repository provides **3D-printable EEG electrodes** designed for **dry-contact** applications. The models are based on **scientific research** for improved **wearing comfort and signal quality**. These electrodes can be used in **EEG caps** for **brain monitoring, neurofeedback, BCI applications, and long-term EEG recordings**.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Download the `.obj` file** for the electrode you want to print.
2. **Use a 3D printer** (recommended: **TPU filament**) to fabricate the electrode.
3. **Apply Ag/AgCl coating** (if needed) to improve conductivity.
4. **Attach to an EEG cap** and connect to your EEG system.
5. **Start recording high-quality brain signals**!
