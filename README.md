# EEG_electrodes# 🧠 3D-Printed EEG Electrode (OBJ Model)

## Overview
This repository contains a **3D model of a dry EEG electrode** designed for **brain-computer interfaces (BCI)**, **neurofeedback**, and **EEG research**. The **.obj file** can be used for **3D printing** and further modifications.

This design is inspired by the research study: [The Arch Electrode: A Novel Dry Electrode Concept for Improved Wearing Comfort](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.748100/full).

## 🎨 3D Model Details
- **Format:** `.obj`
- **Material:** Recommended **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)**
- **Printing Resolution:** **100-200 µm layer height**
- **Supports:** May be required for fine details

### **Printing Instructions**
1. **Download** the `electrode.obj` file.
2. Open in **3D slicing software** (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
3. Set **infill** to **30-50%** for durability.
4. Print using a **flexible filament** like **TPU**.
5. (Optional) Apply **Silver/Silver-Chloride (Ag/AgCl) coating** for improved conductivity.
