This repository provides **3D-printable EEG electrodes** designed for **dry-contact** applications. The models were created in **Plasticity 3D** based on **scientific research** to enhance **wearing comfort and signal quality**. These electrodes can be integrated into **EEG caps** for **brain monitoring, neurofeedback, BCI applications, and long-term EEG recordings**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

1. **Download the `.obj` file** for the electrode you want to print.  
2. **Use a 3D printer** (recommended: **TPU filament**) to fabricate the electrode.  
3. **Apply Ag/AgCl coating** (if needed) to improve conductivity.  
4. **Attach to an EEG cap** and connect to your EEG system.  
5. **Start recording high-quality brain signals**!
